# Redirect Tracker

This script is designed to follow the trail of HTTP(S) redirects when accessing a web domain. It is helpful for debugging, SEO analysis, and tracking the final destination of a URL.

## Features

- Follows up to 10 redirects by default.
- Logs the entire redirect chain along with status codes and IP addresses.
- Warns if a redirect attempts to initiate a file download.
- User-Agent string mimicry for improved website compatibility.
- Uses Python's `requests` library for handling HTTP requests.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `requests` library

To install the required `requests` library, run the following:

```bash
pip install requests

```
#Usage
To use the script, run it with Python and enter the domain you wish to track:
Enter the domain: example.com


When creating a `README.md` file, ensure it provides a clear description of what the script does, how to set it up, and how to use it. It's also good practice to include information on contributing to the project and the license under which it is released.
